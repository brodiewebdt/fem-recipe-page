## Overview

### The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this recipe page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I haven't used tables much recently, so this was a good refresher. I used one spacing variable and the calc function, so I can change all the spacing for the entire page with one variable. I also used the BEM methodology and @font-face for the fonts.
